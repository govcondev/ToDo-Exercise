# ToDo-Exercise
## Project Description
ToDo Exercise: This was a simple exercise to create a styled ToDo list application in React.
### How to Run
   - Fork or download the files
   - Open a command line or terminal window and navigate to the root of where the files/folders are
   - Within the same command-line window, run **npm install** to install all dependencies

### Roadmap of Future Improvements 
1. **Continue to style:** Add more features to the application as necessary.
### File Structure
